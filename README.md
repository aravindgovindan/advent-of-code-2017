## Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming advent calendar consisting of 25 programming puzzles that are released one day at a time, starting on December 1 every year. Each puzzles has two parts and is designed to be challenging and to teach new programming concepts. They can be solved in any programming language.

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2017 programming challenge. Each day's code is in a separate file, named after the day of the challenge. I have written the code in Javascript and hence can be run directly from the browser console itself.
